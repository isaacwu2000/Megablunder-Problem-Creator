# Megablunder-Problem-Creator
Megablunders consist of eight common, notoriously difficult grammatical errors. To help my classmates gain more practice on them, I created an AI problem generator. It uses structured output from the Gemini API to write the problems to a file. In addiiton, the generation prompt was optimized to generate high-quality, difficult problems.
