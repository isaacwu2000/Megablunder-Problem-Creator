However, the subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'the rocket's launch sequence.' Since a launch sequence cannot perform the action of calibrating, the modifier is left 'dangling' without a proper noun to modify at the beginning of the main clause.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed the geological strata and seismic data,] (B) the probability of a catastrophic earthquake within the next decade [was determined by the research team] (C) to be alarmingly high, a conclusion that, despite its rigorous scientific backing, has been met with considerable skepticism from public officials [for whom] (D) the economic implications of large-scale retrofitting projects [seem] (E) more immediate than the distant threat of natural disaster.",B,"Option (B) contains a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed the geological strata and seismic data,' must modify the subject of the main clause that follows. The subject of the main clause is 'the probability.' However, 'the probability' is an abstract concept that cannot perform the action of analyzing data; the research team, which appears later in the sentence, is the implied subject of the participle. Because the implied subject of the verbal phrase is not the subject of the main clause, the modifier dangles. Option (C) is a correct passive voice construction. Option (D) correctly uses the object case pronoun 'whom' as the object of the preposition 'for'. Option (E) contains no error; the plural verb 'seem' correctly agrees with its plural subject 'implications'.",DM,hard_length,True
"After meticulously analyzing the defendant's labyrinthine and often contradictory statements [and] (B) scrutinizing the complex forensic evidence which the prosecution team presented with theatrical flair, [a guilty verdict] (C), one that surprised even the most seasoned court observers, was reached with surprising swiftness by the jury, [who had been] (D) sequestered for the entirety of the long and arduous trial, [thus concluding] (E) a case that had captivated the public for months.",C,"Option (C) creates a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory phrase, 'After meticulously analyzing...flair,' has an implied subject—the jury—that is performing the actions of analyzing and scrutinizing. However, the actual subject of the main clause is 'a guilty verdict.' A verdict cannot perform the actions described in the introductory phrase, so the phrase does not logically modify the subject, causing it to dangle.",DM,hard_length,True
"[To fully appreciate] (B) the intricate network of canals and the architectural marvels of the Renaissance palazzos lining the Grand Canal, a gondola ride through the city's labyrinthine waterways is considered by many seasoned travelers [to be] (C) an absolute necessity, offering a perspective [that is] (D) simultaneously intimate and grandiose and which encapsulates the unique charm that [has defined] (E) Venice for centuries.",B,"Option (B) introduces a dangling modifier (DM). The introductory infinitive phrase 'To fully appreciate...' requires a logical subject to perform the action of appreciating. However, the subject of the main clause that follows is 'a gondola ride'. A gondola ride cannot appreciate architecture. Because the implied subject of the infinitive phrase (e.g., 'a tourist,' 'one') is not the subject of the main clause, the modifier 'dangles' without anything to logically connect to. Option (C), 'to be', is a correct infinitive following the passive verb 'is considered'. Option (D), 'that is', correctly begins an adjective clause modifying 'perspective'. Option (E), 'has defined', is a verb in the correct present perfect tense agreeing with its singular subject 'charm'.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed] (B) the defendant's inconsistent testimony and cross-referencing it with the compelling forensic evidence, the jury's final decision, which was to find him guilty on all counts, [was announced] (C) with a gravity that [underscored] (D) the trial's profound consequences for [everyone involved] (E).",B,"Option (B) introduces a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed the defendant's inconsistent testimony and cross-referencing it with the compelling forensic evidence,' has an implied subject that performs the action of analyzing and cross-referencing (presumably, the jury). However, the subject of the main clause that follows is 'the jury's final decision.' A decision, an abstract concept, cannot perform the action of analyzing testimony. Because the implied subject of the verbal phrase is not the same as the subject of the main clause, the phrase dangles. The other options are correct: (C) is a passive verb phrase that correctly agrees with its singular subject 'decision'; (D) is a verb that correctly agrees with its subject 'that'; (E) is a standard noun phrase.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having been thoroughly vetted by a panel of experts and subsequently translated into a dozen languages] (B), the international community's reaction to the controversial treaty was overwhelmingly negative, a response [that] (C) few diplomats had foreseen given the initial widespread support [for its] (D) foundational principles and the extensive negotiations that had preceded [its ratification] (E).",B,"Option (B) contains a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase 'Having been thoroughly vetted by a panel of experts and subsequently translated into a dozen languages' requires a logical subject to modify. The subject of the main clause that follows is 'the international community's reaction'. A 'reaction' cannot be vetted or translated. The implied subject of the phrase (something like 'the treaty' or 'the document') does not appear as the subject of the main clause, causing the modifier to dangle.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed] (B) the defendant's alibi and cross-examined the prosecution's key witnesses, whose testimonies [were] (C) riddled with inconsistencies that called into question their veracity, the jury's final verdict, which stunned everyone in the packed courtroom, [was delivered] (D) with a surprising swiftness that [belied] (E) the contentious and complex nature of the month-long trial.",B,"Option (B) introduces a dangling modifier (DM). The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed the defendant's alibi and cross-examined the prosecution's key witnesses,' needs a logical subject to modify. The implied subject of the participles 'analyzing' and 'cross-examining' would be the defense attorney or legal team. However, the subject of the main clause that follows is 'the jury's final verdict.' Since the verdict did not perform the actions described in the participial phrase, the modifier dangles, creating a grammatical error.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Scrutinizing the intricate financial records] (B) that had been buried in the archives for nearly a century, a pattern of embezzlement and systemic fraud, previously unsuspected by historians and economists [alike, emerged] (C) with startling clarity, [revealing] (D) a network of corruption that extended to the highest echelons of the early 20th-century banking industry and [calling] (E) into question the integrity of several foundational economic theories.",B,"Option (B) contains a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase, 'Scrutinizing the intricate financial records that had been buried in the archives for nearly a century,' has an implied subject—the person or people doing the scrutinizing. However, the subject of the main clause that follows is 'a pattern of embezzlement and systemic fraud.' Since a 'pattern' cannot scrutinize records, the introductory phrase has nothing to logically modify and is therefore dangling. The other options are correct: (C) contains the main verb 'emerged,' which correctly agrees with its subject 'pattern'; (D) and (E) begin parallel participial phrases that correctly modify the action of the entire main clause.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed] (B) the defendant's inconsistent testimony and cross-referenced it with the forensic evidence presented by the prosecution, the verdict of guilty, which was announced to a silent courtroom, [seemed] (C) not only justified but also an inevitable conclusion to the highly publicized and emotionally [charged trial, a proceeding that] (D) had captivated the nation for weeks and [whose] (E) outcome was anticipated with bated breath by millions.",B,"Option (B) is part of a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed the defendant's inconsistent testimony and cross-referenced it with the forensic evidence presented by the prosecution,' must modify the subject of the main clause that follows. The subject of the main clause is 'the verdict of guilty.' A verdict cannot perform the action of analyzing or cross-referencing. The implied subject of the participle (e.g., the jury, the judge) is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, causing the introductory phrase to dangle without a logical noun to modify.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed the geological data collected from the Martian rover over several years,] (B) the compelling evidence for subterranean water reservoirs, [which] (C) could potentially support microbial life, [was presented] (D) by the research team, whose findings were later corroborated by an independent study [that used] (E) advanced spectral imaging techniques.",B,"Option (B) contains a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed the geological data...', requires its implied subject to be the same as the subject of the main clause. The implied subject of the action 'analyzing' is 'the research team'. However, the subject of the main clause is 'the compelling evidence'. Because the evidence did not perform the analysis, the participial phrase dangles, having no logical noun to modify. The other options are correct: (C) 'which' properly introduces a non-restrictive clause modifying 'reservoirs'; (D) 'was presented' correctly agrees in number with the singular subject 'evidence'; (E) 'that used' correctly begins an adjective clause modifying 'study'.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed the geological data collected over several decades from multiple remote sensing stations,] (B) the impending volcanic eruption, a catastrophic event predicted to alter the global climate for years, [was forecasted] (C) with astonishing accuracy by the team of seismologists, [who] (D) subsequently issued a series of urgent warnings that, [despite their] (E) gravity, were initially met with widespread public skepticism.",B,"Option (B) is a dangling modifier (DM). The introductory participial phrase 'Having meticulously analyzed...' must modify the subject of the main clause. The implied subject of this phrase is 'the team of seismologists', but the grammatical subject of the main clause is 'the impending volcanic eruption'. An eruption cannot analyze data. Therefore, the phrase dangles. The other options are correct: (C) 'was forecasted' agrees with the singular subject 'eruption'; (D) 'who' is the correct relative pronoun for 'seismologists'; and (E) the pronoun 'their' correctly refers to the plural antecedent 'warnings'.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed the defendant's alibi and uncovering a crucial inconsistency] (B) in the timeline provided by the key witness, the prosecution's case suddenly gained an undeniable advantage during the trial's final days, a development [that surprised] (C) even the most seasoned legal observers and [prompted] (D) the defense attorney, who had been confident of an acquittal, [to request] (E) an immediate recess to reconsider his strategy.",B,"Option (B) contains a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed the defendant's alibi and uncovering a crucial inconsistency,' must modify the subject of the main clause that follows. The implied subject of the action 'analyzing' and 'uncovering' is a person, such as the prosecutor. However, the subject of the main clause is 'the prosecution's case.' A case cannot analyze an alibi or uncover an inconsistency. Because the phrase does not logically modify the subject of the main clause, it is a dangling modifier.",DM,hard_length,True
"Having meticulously analyzed the vast datasets from the Kepler Space Telescope and cross-referenced them with spectral analyses from numerous ground-based observatories, [a previously unknown exoplanet] (B) with Earth-like characteristics was finally identified by the international team, [a finding that] (C) fundamentally alters current planetary formation models and [that challenges] (D) long-held assumptions about the rarity of such worlds [in our galaxy] (E).",B,"Option (B) initiates the main clause with a subject, 'a previously unknown exoplanet,' that cannot logically serve as the subject for the introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed...'. The implied subject of the introductory phrase is the group of people who performed the analysis (in this case, 'the international team'), but the actual subject of the main clause is 'a previously unknown exoplanet'. Because the modifier does not modify the subject of the main clause, it is a dangling modifier (DM).",DM,hard_length,True
"[After extensively] (B) researching the molecular structure of the newly discovered enzyme, which exhibits properties previously thought to be biologically impossible, [the breakthrough] (C) was announced not by the junior researcher who performed the bulk of the work [but by] (D) the lab's senior director, [who took] (E) full credit for the discovery in a widely publicized press conference.",C,"Option (C) is the subject of the main clause and creates a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory phrase, 'After extensively researching the molecular structure of the newly discovered enzyme...', contains the gerund 'researching'. The implied subject of this action is a person (the researcher). However, the actual subject of the main clause that follows is 'the breakthrough'. A breakthrough cannot perform research. Because the implied subject of the introductory verbal phrase does not match the subject of the main clause, the phrase is a dangling modifier.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously mixed] (B) the pigments on a worn mahogany palette to achieve a unique, ethereal shade of cerulean blue, the final, delicate brushstroke was applied with a sable brush [to the sprawling] (C) canvas, a monumental work that had consumed nearly a decade of the artist's life and which, [according to] (D) some critics, redefined the boundaries of contemporary abstract [expressionism.] (E)",B,"Option (B) introduces a participial phrase, 'Having meticulously mixed the pigments...'. The implied subject of the action 'mixing' is the artist. However, the grammatical subject of the main clause that follows is 'the final, delicate brushstroke'. Since a brushstroke cannot perform the action of mixing pigments, the introductory phrase has no logical noun to modify, making it a dangling modifier (DM). The sentence structure incorrectly suggests that the brushstroke mixed the pigments before being applied.",DM,hard_length,True

The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed decades of historical data...', must modify the subject of the main clause. The implied subject of this phrase—the one doing the analyzing—is the 'chief economist.' However, the actual subject of the main clause is 'the final report.' A report cannot analyze data; a person does. Because the implied subject of the modifier does not match the subject of the main clause, the phrase is left dangling, creating a grammatical error.",DM,hard_length,True
"[Having meticulously analyzed] (B) the geological data and cross-referencing it with seismic activity reports from several independent observatories, a new hypothesis about the volcano's imminent eruption [was formulated] (C) by the research team, [which] (D) argued that previous models had consistently underestimated the magmatic pressure building [beneath the caldera] (E).",B,"Option (B) introduces a dangling modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase, 'Having meticulously analyzed the geological data and cross-referencing it with seismic activity reports from several independent observatories,' must modify the subject of the main clause.
