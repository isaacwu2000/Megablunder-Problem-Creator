"While the extent of this improvement [that] (B) can be attributed to Trotsky is difficult to discern, especially when one considers that some improvement could be attributed to economic recovery from the Great War and the Russian Civil War as well as various other NEP [policies because] (C) Trotsky created the [unanimously approved] (D) four-stage plan, which guided economic policies during the NEP-era, and he advocated [heavily] (E) for the electrification of Russia prior to his lackluster time as a director of the ETO, a significant portion of the improvement in power generation can be credited to Trotsky.",A,"There are no errors in this sentence. Option (B), 'that', correctly introduces a restrictive adjective clause modifying 'improvement'. Option (C), 'policies because', appropriately uses 'because' to introduce a subordinate clause of reason, logically connecting to the preceding ideas about NEP policies. Option (D), 'unanimously approved', features the adverb 'unanimously' correctly modifying the participial adjective 'approved', which describes 'four-stage plan'. Option (E), 'heavily', is an adverb correctly modifying the verb 'advocated'. The sentence, though complex, maintains grammatical integrity without issues in sentence completeness, pronoun reference, agreement, case, or modifier placement.",A,hard_length,Human
"The array of volatile variables[, along with] (B) the coefficients derived from inconsistent models, [suggest] (C) the conclusion remains unsubstantiated [because] (D) neither the assumptions nor the results correspond consistently with empirical observations, [which] (E) trouble the most experienced statisticians.",C,"Option (C), 'suggest', is an AGREEMENT error. The true subject of the verb is 'The array'. The phrase 'along with the coefficients derived from inconsistent models' is an intervening prepositional phrase and does not affect the number of the subject. Since 'array' is a singular noun, it requires a singular verb. The singular form of the verb 'suggest' is 'suggests'. The rule for subject-verb agreement states that a singular subject takes a singular verb.",AGREE,hard_length,Human
[Showcasing] (B) a rare Ming Dynasty manuscript—known for [its] (C) thin brushstrokes and mulberry-bark paper fibers—the curator presented the masterpiece to a group of tourists [who] (D) [had been kept] (E) in airtight chambers for preservation.,E,"Option (E), as part of the clause 'who (D) had been kept (E) in airtight chambers for preservation', contributes to a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. The adjective clause 'who had been kept in airtight chambers for preservation' is positioned so that it incorrectly modifies 'a group of tourists'. Logically, it is the 'rare Ming Dynasty manuscript' or 'the masterpiece' that would have been kept in airtight chambers for preservation, not the tourists. Adjective clauses must be placed immediately following the noun they modify to avoid such ludicrous or misleading interpretations.",MM,hard_length,Human
"A carbon tax would generate significant funds [amounting] (B) to [nearly] (C) 125 million dollars; with the money generated from a carbon tax, the government should invest in social services: 10% of [it] (D) should go to low-income households and the rest should go to the most pressing issues at the time of the carbon tax, [which] (E) are currently the government deficit and a potential default.",D,"Option (D), 'it', is a PRONOUN REFERENCE (PR) error. The pronoun 'it' is singular, but its antecedent is ambiguous. While 'the money generated from a carbon tax' is a singular concept mentioned nearby, the earlier prominent noun 'funds' is plural. A pronoun must refer clearly to a single, unambiguous noun. If 'it' is intended to refer to 'funds', there is a number mismatch. If it refers to 'the money', the connection could be clearer, as the presence of 'funds' might lead a reader to be unsure which noun the writer intended, thus violating the principle that one should be able to put a finger on the specific noun a pronoun refers to without ambiguity.",PR,hard_length,Human
"[There] (B) is a common belief [that] (C) pirates killed [whoever] (D) they saw, but [this] (E) belief is false.",D,"The pronoun 'whoever' functions as the direct object of the verb 'saw' within the clause 'whoever they saw' (they saw whom?). According to the guide, pronouns used as objects must be in the object case. The object case for 'whoever' is 'whomever'.",CASE,hard_trick,Human
"Once the memoir was released, [with] (B) [its] (C) fragmented prose and deliberately inconsistent chronology, [it became clear] (D) that the audience would not respond uniformly, a response [which] (E) frustrated reviewers who struggled to determine the memoir’s purpose.",A,"The sentence contains no grammatical errors. The preposition '[with]' (B) correctly introduces a modifying phrase without creating an incomplete sentence or an improperly joined one. The possessive pronoun '[its]' (C) clearly refers to the singular noun 'memoir,' demonstrating correct pronoun reference and agreement in number with its antecedent. The phrase '[it became clear]' (D) properly uses 'it' as a placeholder subject for the subsequent noun clause, and the singular verb 'became' agrees with this placeholder. Finally, the relative pronoun '[which]' (E) appropriately introduces an adjective clause modifying the specific noun 'response' that immediately precedes it, thus avoiding the issue of a pronoun referring vaguely to an entire preceding idea. This adjective clause is correctly placed, and 'which' functions as the subject within its own clause, satisfying case requirements.",A,hard_trick,Human
"If I [was] (B) in Ms. Tan's class and [in] (C) your situation, I would ask the academic dean[, who is very harsh,] (D) and [Ms. Tan] (E) for an extension on the history paper.",B,"Option (B), 'was', is an AGREE error. The sentence begins with 'If' and describes a hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situation ('If I was... I would ask...'), which requires the subjunctive mood for the verb in the 'if' clause. For the verb 'to be' in the past subjunctive, the correct form for all persons, including 'I', is 'were'. Therefore, the sentence should read 'If I were in Ms. Tan's class...'. Using 'was' instead of 'were' in this conditional context violates the requirement for the correct verb form to agree with the subjunctive mood, a principle related to ensuring verbs match their grammatical context, akin to how correct tense usage is part of agreement.",AGREE,hard_trick,Human
"[The pot boiling from the flames,] (B) the special potion was made by the evil witch [despite] (C) the [pot’s] (D) [near] (E) bursting.",A,"The sentence contains no grammatical errors. Option (B), '[The pot boiling from the flames,]', is a correctly formed absolute phrase. Such phrases, consisting of a noun ('The pot') followed by a participle ('boiling'), modify the entire main clause ('the special potion was made by the evil witch') by providing attendant circumstances, and they are an exception to the rule that introductory verbal phrases must modify the subject of the main clause, thus it is not a dangling modifier. The preposition '[despite]' (C) correctly introduces a phrase indicating contrast. The possessive noun '[pot’s]' (D) is appropriately used before the gerund 'bursting', as the rules for case dictate that a noun or pronoun before a gerund should be in the possessive form. Finally, '[near]' (E) functions correctly as an adjective modifying 'bursting', indicating the imminence of the action.",A,hard_trick,Human

When subjects are connected by 'nor', the verb agrees with the nearer subject. In this case, the nearer subject to the verb 'have been reviewed' is 'footnotes', which is plural. Therefore, the plural verb 'have been reviewed' is correct. My apologies, I have made an error in my analysis. The original sentence is actually correct.

This participial phrase is positioned to modify 'the final movement', suggesting that the movement itself was wearing the jacket. Logically, it is 'The violinist' who was wearing the jacket. Modifiers should be placed close to the word they modify to avoid such illogical or confusing interpretations.",MM,medium,Human
I know [that] (B) you [knew] (C) that I'm [as wise as] (D) [him] (E).,E,"Option (E), 'him', is a CASE error. This sentence contains an elliptical construction, where part of the clause is omitted but understood. The full comparison is 'I'm as wise as him (is)'. In such comparisons, the pronoun should be in the subject case because it is the subject of the implied verb 'is'. Therefore, 'him' (object case) should be 'he' (subject case).

Option (B), 'promises', is a singular verb that correctly agrees with its singular subject 'strategy'; the intervening noun 'protocols' does not affect the agreement. Option (C), 'who', is the correct subjective case pronoun, serving as the subject of the verb 'were' in the clause modifying 'managers'. Option (D), 'a group', is a grammatically sound appositive that renames 'the board of directors'.

Option (B), 'whose', is the correct possessive pronoun referring back to 'leader'. Option (C), 'remains', is a singular verb that correctly agrees with its singular subject, 'legacy'; the extensive phrases between the subject and verb, which contain many plural nouns, do not alter the required verb form. Option (D), 'who', is the correct subject-case pronoun to introduce the adjective clause modifying 'scholars', as it functions as the subject of the verb 'argue'.

Options (D) and (E) are part of a grammatically parallel series of gerund phrases ('revising the convoluted tax codes', 'streamlining the procedures', and 'auditing provincial treasuries') correctly structured with the correlative conjunction 'not only... but also'.

The introductory participial phrase, 'Having painstakingly compiled data...', correctly modifies the subject of the main clause, 'the international consortium of climatologists,' as the consortium is the entity that performed the action of compiling. Option (B), 'its', is a singular possessive pronoun that correctly refers to the singular collective noun 'consortium'. Option (C), 'concludes', is a singular verb that correctly agrees with the singular subject 'consortium'. Option (D), 'that', properly introduces an adjective clause modifying 'phenomenon'.

The subject of the main clause is 'The primary challenge' (singular). The verb 'stem' is in its plural form and does not agree with the singular subject. It should be 'stems' to correctly match 'The primary challenge'. Option (B), '[which typically struggle]', is correct as 'which' refers to the plural 'nations', and 'struggle' is the appropriate plural verb.

In the subordinate clause 'each of which were intended', the true subject governing the verb is the indefinite pronoun 'each', which is always singular. Therefore, the verb must agree in number and be singular. The correct form should be 'each of which *was* intended', not 'were intended'. Options (C), (D), and (E) are grammatically correct. In (C), 'series' is a singular collective noun, taking the singular verb 'has been met'. In (D), 'the government' is the singular subject, and the intervening phrase 'along with many of its closest allies' does not affect the singular verb 'insists'.

The subject of the verb 'were' is 'data analysis', which is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb should be singular, 'was', not plural 'were'.

The true subject of the main clause is 'collection', which is a singular noun. The verb 'were believed' is plural and therefore does not agree with its singular subject. The intervening phrase starting with 'each meticulously restored and framed' modifies 'maps' within the prepositional phrase 'of antique maps' and does not alter the singular number of the subject 'collection'.

The subject of the main clause is 'deliberations', which is a plural noun. However, the verb 'was met' is singular. To maintain subject-verb agreement, the verb should be plural, 'were met'. The long intervening relative clause 'which often spanned several weeks and involved numerous contentious debates' might obscure the true subject-verb relationship, leading to the error. Option (B) 'spanned' correctly uses the past tense verb for the plural subject 'which' (referring to 'deliberations'). Option (D) 'that' is an appropriate relative pronoun introducing an adjective clause modifying 'response'. Option (E) 'no one' is a singular indefinite pronoun, but the verb 'had anticipated' is in the past perfect tense and does not require number agreement with the subject in this context.",AGR,hard_trick,AI + Human

The compound subject 'neither the fervent appeals... nor the increasingly dire reports...' consists of two plural nouns ('appeals' and 'reports') connected by 'neither... nor'.

The main subject of the sentence is the singular noun 'mosaic' (The intricate mosaic... have). Despite the intervening plural nouns 'traditions' and 'trends' and the complex relative clause, the main verb must agree with 'mosaic'. Therefore, the plural verb 'have' should be the singular 'has' ('The intricate mosaic... has long been...'). Options (B), (D), and (E) are grammatically correct. In (B), the relative pronoun 'which' correctly refers to the plural 'cultural traditions and contemporary trends' (as indicated by 'in their rich tapestry'), so the plural verb 'shape' is appropriate.

To correctly agree with the plural subject 'patterns,' the verb should be 'have.' The intervening phrase 'of migratory birds, many of which follow ancestral routes with uncanny precision' modifies 'patterns' but does not change the number of the subject. Therefore, the sentence should read 'The intricate patterns... have always fascinated ornithologists...' Option (C), 'their,' correctly refers to the plural antecedent 'migratory birds' as the possessor of the 'unwavering instinct.'

The true subject of the main clause is the singular noun 'interplay'. The phrase 'along with the meticulous brushwork' functions as a prepositional phrase modifying 'interplay'; it does not create a compound subject that would require a plural verb.

The true subject of the main clause is 'The intricate tapestry', which is a singular noun. Therefore, the main verb that agrees with 'tapestry' must also be singular.

Therefore, 'only' should modify the condition under which the advice is given ('after all conventional treatments have proven ineffective').

The adverb 'only' is placed directly before 'to award', which implies that the committee's sole action was to award, rather than, for example, deny or postpone. However, the logical intent of the sentence is to restrict *who* receives the scholarship, meaning 'only' should modify 'students'.

The adverbial phrase 'repeatedly during office hours' is intended to modify the verb 'assigned,' indicating that the professor assigned the proofs repeatedly at that time.

The adjective clause 'which had been painstakingly excavated from a deep volcanic ash layer' is intended to modify 'a perfectly preserved obsidian mirror'.

The introductory participial phrase 'Having meticulously researched esoteric legal precedents' describes an action performed by someone. The grammatical subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'a surprising verdict'. A verdict cannot logically perform the action of researching legal precedents.

Option (C), 'which', is correctly used as a relative pronoun to refer to 'the intricate web of regulations', a noun phrase, and not to an entire preceding clause, thus avoiding a general reference PR error.

Option (D), 'to new businesses', correctly functions as a prepositional phrase, with 'businesses' serving as the object of the preposition 'to'.

Option (E), 'along with her dedicated team', is a prepositional phrase that modifies 'the experienced consultant' and does not alter the number of the subject 'consultant'. Therefore, the singular subject 'consultant' correctly takes the singular implied verb in the main clause. This avoids an AGR error.",A,medium,AI + Human

There are no Megablunder errors in any of the choices. Option (B) 'the subtle nuances' is a correct noun phrase. Option (C) 'which frequently defied' correctly uses 'which' to refer to 'language' (singular) and the past tense verb 'defied', which does not change form for singular or plural subjects. Option (D) 'it became' correctly uses the expletive pronoun 'it' to introduce the main clause. Option (E) 'predicted to befall' is a correctly placed participial phrase modifying 'cataclysm'.

Option (C) 'into a usable' correctly uses the preposition 'into' for conversion and 'usable' as an adjective. Option (D) 'has recently garnered' demonstrates correct subject-verb agreement; the singular subject 'discovery' correctly takes the singular verb 'has garnered'. Option (E) 'validating their' uses a participial phrase appropriately to modify the main clause's action, and 'their' correctly refers to the plural 'researchers'' (implied from 'researchers' groundbreaking discovery').

Option (B), 'conducted by her team', is a participial phrase correctly modifying 'research'. Option (C), 'found that the groundbreaking hypothesis', uses the singular verb 'found' to agree with the singular subject 'scientist', and 'that' correctly introduces a noun clause. Option (D), 'unsustainable, causing a major shift', contains a participial phrase that functions as an acceptable sentence modifier, explaining a consequence of the hypothesis proving unsustainable.

The subject of the sentence is 'A series', which is singular. The verb must agree in number with its subject. Therefore, the singular verb 'has complicated' should be used instead of the plural 'have complicated'. The intervening phrases, such as 'of unexpected events' and 'the sudden resignation of the CEO and the collapse of key negotiations', contain plural nouns, but these do not change the number of the singular subject 'A series'.",AGR,medium,AI + Human

When subjects are connected by 'neither...nor', the verb agrees with the nearer subject. In this sentence, the nearer subject to the verb 'was understood' is 'the practical applications', which is plural. Therefore, the verb should be plural, 'were understood', to agree with 'applications'. The singular verb 'was understood' creates a subject-verb agreement error.",AGR,medium,AI + Human

When subjects are connected by 'neither...nor', the verb must agree in number with the subject closer to it. In this sentence, the nearer subject to the verb 'reveals' is 'the faded colors of its threads', which is plural. Therefore, the singular verb 'reveals' should be the plural 'reveal'.",AGR,medium,AI + Human

The subject of the sentence is 'array', which is a singular noun. Although 'challenges' is plural and intervenes between the subject and the verb, the verb must agree in number with the singular subject 'array'. Therefore, the singular verb 'has' should be used instead of the plural 'have'. The correct phrasing would be 'has often led'.",AGR,medium,AI + Human

The sentence presents a series of ideas that should be expressed in similar grammatical structures.

When ideas are connected by correlative conjunctions like 'not only...but also', they must be expressed in similar grammatical structures. The first part of the construction, 'to cut departmental expenses', is an infinitive phrase. However, the second part, 'a significant increase in quarterly profits', is a noun phrase.

When ideas are connected by correlative conjunctions like 'not only... but also', they must be expressed in similar grammatical structures. In this sentence, 'not only' introduces the infinitive phrase 'to amend the proposal'. However, 'but also' then introduces the noun clause 'that they would re-evaluate the entire project scope'.

The correlative conjunctions 'both...and' connect two ideas that must be expressed in similar grammatical structures. 'Singing loudly' (B) is a gerund phrase, but 'that he could compose intricate melodies' (C) is a noun clause.

The sentence presents a series of ideas (the components of the strategic plan) that should be expressed in similar grammatical structures. The first two items in the series, 'to streamline operations' and 'to allocate resources more efficiently', are infinitive phrases.

The sentence uses the correlative conjunctions 'not only...but also' to connect two main ideas. The structure following 'not only' is a compound infinitive phrase ('to cut operational costs and to boost shareholder confidence').

Correlative conjunctions like 'not only...but also' demand that the elements they connect be grammatically parallel. In this sentence, 'not only' introduces the infinitive phrase 'to implement stricter disciplinary policies'. However, 'but also' introduces the noun phrase 'the introduction of a new honor code'.

The sentence presents a list of characteristics for which the critic was renowned: 'his discerning palate' (a noun phrase), 'his meticulous notes on flavor profiles' (another noun phrase), and 'how incisively he could dissect a dish’s conceptual framework' (a noun clause). For proper parallelism in a series, all items should be expressed in similar grammatical structures.

The sentence uses the correlative conjunctions 'not only...but also' and then continues with 'and' to list three reasons for the professor's celebration. For these reasons to be grammatically parallel, they must share a similar structure. The first reason, 'for his profound contributions to theoretical physics,' is a prepositional phrase. The third reason, 'for his unwavering commitment to mentoring aspiring researchers,' is also a prepositional phrase. However, option (C) is an adverb clause.

The sentence presents a series of ideas following 'the importance of' that should maintain a consistent grammatical structure. 'Clarity in writing' (B) and 'conciseness in expression' (C) are both noun phrases (or gerund phrases acting as nouns, if 'writing' and 'expression' are viewed as gerunds).

The correlative conjunctions 'not only...but also' connect two ideas: 'to the meticulous analysis of ancient hieroglyphs' and 'from engaging in extensive archaeological excavations'. For proper parallelism, the grammatical structure immediately following 'not only' should match the structure immediately following 'but also'. Here, 'to the meticulous analysis' is an infinitive phrase (or a prepositional phrase with an object 'analysis'), while 'from engaging' is a prepositional phrase with a gerund.

The pronoun introduces a clause where it functions as the subject of the verb 'was involved'.

The eccentric professor lectured about the newly discovered ancient manuscript in the university's cavernous auditorium [that contained cryptic symbols and a previously unknown dialect] (B) to a packed audience of eager students.,B,"Option (B), 'that contained cryptic symbols and a previously unknown dialect', is a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. This adjective clause is meant to modify 'manuscript', describing its contents. However, its current placement immediately after 'auditorium' incorrectly suggests that the auditorium contained the cryptic symbols and unknown dialect, which is illogical. Adjective clauses must immediately follow the noun they modify to ensure clarity.",MM,medium,AI + Human
"The antique clock, [with its intricate gears and hand-painted dial] (B), chimed precisely at noon [that had been carefully restored by a master horologist] (C), filling the grand hall with a resonant tone.",C,"Option (C), 'that had been carefully restored by a master horologist', is a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. This adjective clause is meant to modify 'The antique clock', describing its condition.

"The artist painted the mural [that adorned] (B) the town square [vibrantly] (C), using bold strokes and [an array] (D) of colors [to capture] (E) the spirit of the community.",C,"Option (C), 'vibrantly', is a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. The adverb 'vibrantly' is intended to describe how the artist 'painted' the mural. However, its placement at the end of the adjective clause 'that adorned the town square' causes it to ambiguously modify 'adorned' or even the 'town square', neither of which makes logical sense in the context of the sentence. Adverbial modifiers should be placed closer to the word they are intended to modify to prevent such confusion. The sentence should ideally be structured as 'The artist vibrantly painted the mural that adorned the town square...' or 'The artist painted the mural that adorned the town square, vibrantly using bold strokes...' to clarify that 'vibrantly' modifies 'painted'.",MM,medium,AI + Human

The adverb 'only' is misplaced. It is currently positioned to modify 'after extensive debate', suggesting that the *sole* condition for postponing the vote was after the debate. However, 'only' is more logically intended to modify 'a month', emphasizing the duration of the postponement. To convey this meaning, 'only' should be placed before 'a month', as in 'to postpone the vote for only a month'.",MM,medium,AI + Human
"The vigilant security guard spotted a suspicious package [concealed beneath a bench in the park] (B) [that appeared to be ticking loudly] (C) moments before the alarm sounded, prompting a swift evacuation [of the entire area] (D) [by emergency services] (E).",C,"Option (C), 'that appeared to be ticking loudly', is a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. This adjective clause is positioned directly after 'park', which suggests that the park itself was ticking loudly. Logically, it is the 'suspicious package' that would be ticking.

The detective meticulously [examined] (B) the intricate pattern of fingerprints [that were left] (C) on the antique desk [for hours] (D) [before] (E) calling for backup.,D,"Option (D), 'for hours', is a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. This adverbial phrase is intended to modify the verb 'examined', indicating how long the detective performed the action. However, its current placement after 'antique desk' makes it seem to illogically modify 'desk' or the act of 'being left', which creates an unintended meaning or ambiguity. To correct this, 'for hours' should be placed closer to 'examined', such as 'The detective meticulously examined for hours...', or at the beginning of the sentence.",MM,medium,AI + Human

The adverb 'only' is misplaced. Logically, 'only' is intended to modify 'a few indigenous tribes', indicating that *just* a few tribes had explored the range, and no others. As it is currently positioned, 'only' appears to modify the verb phrase 'had been explored', suggesting an unintended meaning (e.g., that exploration was the sole activity, rather than, say, settlement). To correct this, 'only' should be placed directly before the phrase it modifies: 'that had been explored only by a few indigenous tribes'.",MM,medium,AI + Human

This adjective clause is intended to modify 'World War II', as it was the war that drastically reshaped global politics.

The adverb 'only' is often misplaced, tending to gravitate toward the main verb even when it logically belongs with another part of the sentence. In this sentence, the intended meaning is that the author submitted his manuscript *only to a small, independent publisher*, implying a limitation on the recipient, not on the act of submitting itself.

The adverb 'carefully' is a 'squinting' modifier because its position makes it ambiguous whether it modifies the preceding verb 'were studying' or the following verb 'observed'. It could mean the researchers were careful in their studying or careful in their observing. To correct this, the adverb should be placed unambiguously, for example, 'The researchers who were carefully studying the rare species observed...' or 'The researchers who were studying the rare species observed the creatures' nocturnal habits carefully...'.",MM,medium,AI + Human

This adverbial phrase logically describes *how* the scientist analyzed the samples, meaning it should modify the verb 'analyzed'. However, its placement at the end of the sentence, far from 'analyzed' and adjacent to 'riverbed', creates an illogical connection, making it seem as if the riverbed itself was handled with caution.

This prepositional phrase is intended to describe how 'The old woman' watched, but its placement after 'young boy playing in the park' makes it appear to modify the boy or his action, illogically suggesting the boy was playing with her cane or was accompanied by the cane. Modifiers must be placed close to the word they modify to avoid such confusion.

Adjective clauses must immediately follow the noun they modify. In this sentence, the clause 'that was controversial' is positioned to modify 'gallery' due to its immediate proximity. However, the intended meaning is that the *painting* was controversial, not the gallery. The modifier is thus misplaced, creating an illogical interpretation.

"The new exhibit showcased artifacts that were excavated by a team of archaeologists and painstakingly restored [in glass cases] (C) for public viewing, captivating visitors with their intricate details and historical significance.",C,"Option (C), 'in glass cases', is a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. The prepositional phrase 'in glass cases' is positioned to modify 'restored', suggesting that the painstaking restoration process occurred inside glass cases. Logically, the artifacts were painstakingly restored and *then* placed in glass cases for public viewing.

The scientist [only] (B) began to consider the full implications of her discovery [after spending] (C) countless hours [in the lab] (D) and [consulting with her colleagues extensively] (E).,B,"Option (B), 'only', is a MISPLACED MODIFIER (MM) error. The word 'only' is frequently misplaced and tends to gravitate toward the main verb, even though it more logically belongs with a subordinate clause or an expression of number or amount. In this sentence, 'only' is intended to modify the phrase 'after spending countless hours...', indicating that the consideration of the discovery's implications occurred *solely* after a specific period of work and consultation. Its current placement before 'began' suggests that she *only* began to consider, rather than, for example, fully grasping or completing the consideration.

This prepositional phrase, functioning as an adjective, is placed directly after 'new research facility'. This placement incorrectly suggests that the *new* facility, which is yet to be built, already has a leaky roof and crumbling foundation.

The word 'only' should be placed immediately before the phrase it is intended to modify. In this sentence, 'only' is meant to emphasize that the acknowledgment occurred *after* the network crash, rather than indicating that acknowledging was the *sole* action taken. As written, 'only' modifies 'acknowledged', suggesting that acknowledging was the only thing the manager did.

The introductory participial phrase 'Having developed a groundbreaking new algorithm for climate modeling' implies that the subject of the main clause performed the action of developing. However, 'the scientific community' (the subject of the main clause) did not develop the algorithm; Dr. Anya Sharma did. Since the implied subject of the verbal phrase does not match the subject of the main clause, the modifier dangles.

The introductory participial phrase, 'Having diligently reviewed all the financial projections,' implies a subject that performed the action of reviewing (e.g., the finance team or the board).

The introductory participial phrase 'Determined to finally pass the notoriously difficult certification exam' implies that someone or some group is determined. However, the subject of the main clause that follows is 'many late nights'. 'Late nights' cannot be 'determined'; rather, a person or people are determined.

This introductory participial phrase implies that 'the student' was the one diligently preparing for months. However, the grammatical subject of the main clause that follows is 'the crucial exam'. Since the exam itself did not prepare for months, the participial phrase lacks a logical subject to modify, thus creating a dangling modifier.

The introductory participial phrase 'Seeking a rare botanical specimen that had eluded explorers for centuries' implies that the one performing the action of 'seeking' is the expedition or its members. However, the grammatical subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'a remote, uncharted island'. An island cannot 'seek' a specimen, meaning the modifier has nothing logical to modify and thus 'dangles'.

The introductory participial phrase 'Having meticulously prepared for weeks' has an implied subject (Sarah) that is performing the action of preparing. However, the subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'the marathon'. Since the implied subject of the verbal (Sarah) is not the grammatical subject of the main clause ('the marathon'), the phrase dangles, illogically suggesting that the marathon itself prepared for weeks.

A 'verdict' cannot 'weigh evidence' or 'consult experts'; it is something that is reached. The introductory phrase therefore dangles, as it lacks a logical subject to modify in the main clause, creating a DANGLING MODIFIER (DM) error.

The implied subject of the participial phrase 'Having meticulously proofread...' is the one performing the action of proofreading and correcting. However, the subject of the main clause that follows is 'the publishing house'. While a publishing house is responsible for these actions, it is an organization and not the direct agent that physically 'proofreads' or 'corrects' in the same way an individual or a team would.

The introductory phrase 'After meticulously calibrating the intricate machinery for weeks' is a prepositional phrase containing a gerund. The implied subject of this verbal phrase is the person or team performing the calibration. However, the subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'the final experiment'.

The clause 'Which often leads to policy inaction and further environmental degradation' is a relative (or adjective) clause, introduced by the relative pronoun 'which'. As a subordinate clause, it cannot stand alone as a complete sentence; it lacks an independent main clause. Punctuating it as a separate sentence creates a fragment. To correct this, the period before 'Which' should be changed to a comma, connecting it to the preceding main clause.",FRAG,medium,AI + Human
"Many participants in the extreme endurance race, [though extensively trained for months in adverse conditions] (B) and [equipped with state-of-the-art survival gear] (C), [still succumbing to the brutal combination of altitude sickness and dehydration] (D), [their ultimate failure highlighting the unpredictable savagery of the terrain] (E).",D,"Option (D), 'still succumbing to the brutal combination of altitude sickness and dehydration', is a FRAGMENT (FRAG) error because the entire sentence lacks a main clause. The subject 'Many participants' is never followed by a finite verb; instead, it is followed by various modifying phrases, including the participial phrase in option (D). While participial phrases can modify nouns, they cannot serve as the main verb of a sentence. This leaves the sentence punctuated as complete but grammatically incomplete, forming a fragment. To correct this, a finite verb (e.g., 'were succumbing' or 'succumbed') is required.",FRAG,medium,AI + Human
