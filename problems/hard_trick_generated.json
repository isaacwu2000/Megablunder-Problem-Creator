        "answer": "A",
        "solution": "The sentence contains no grammatical errors. Option (B), '[the defendant, his face pale and his composure visibly shaken,]', is grammatically sound. 'The defendant' serves as the subject of the main clause, and the phrase 'his face pale and his composure visibly shaken' functions as a correct absolute phrase, offering additional descriptive detail about the defendant without creating a fragment or misplaced modifier. Option (C), '[even as the jury, their skepticism palpable,]', correctly uses 'their' to refer to the individual members implied by the collective noun 'jury' in this context, which is an acceptable agreement when the focus is on the members rather than the group as a single unit. Option (D), '[him]', is correctly in the object case as it serves as the object of the participle 'finding' within the participial phrase 'ultimately finding him guilty'.

Option (B), '[each proposal submitted by departments, irrespective of its current funding status]', is a complex but correctly structured subject phrase for the subordinate clause, where the possessive pronoun 'its' clearly and correctly refers to the singular noun 'proposal'. Option (C), '[its perceived feasibility,]', maintains proper parallelism with the preceding phrase, with 'its' again referring to 'proposal'. Option (D), '[be reviewed thoroughly]', correctly employs the mandative subjunctive mood, which is required after verbs of demand like 'stipulated'; in this mood, the base form 'be' is used regardless of the singular subject 'each proposal'.

Option (D), '[was untenable; her findings]', correctly uses 'was' for the singular subject 'theory' and the semicolon properly joins two independent clauses.

Option (D), '[rendering them]', uses the participle 'rendering' correctly with 'them' as its object, where 'them' unambiguously refers to 'the council'.

Option (C), '[and arguably most challenging,]', is a non-essential adjectival phrase correctly modifying 'installation' and does not affect the subject-verb agreement of the main clause. Option (D), '[its]', is a possessive pronoun that unambiguously refers to the singular noun 'installation'.

Option (D), '[what she had proposed]', is a correctly formed noun clause acting as the object of the preposition 'of'; 'what' functions as the direct object within its own clause.

Option (C) '[was finally presented]' is correctly in the singular past tense, agreeing with the singular subject 'data'. Option (D) '[each a luminary in their respective fields,]' is a grammatically sound appositive phrase modifying the plural noun 'members', making 'their' an appropriate pronoun referring to 'members'.

Option (B), '[which ultimately proved controversial]', correctly uses 'which' to introduce a non-restrictive adjective clause that modifies 'decision', with 'which' (referring to 'decision') correctly agreeing with the singular verb 'proved'.

Option (D), '[and the considerable risks]', correctly completes the parallel structure initiated by 'both', balancing the noun phrase 'the potential for significant market expansion' with another noun phrase. Option (E), '[this careful balancing]', introduces a grammatically correct absolute phrase, where 'this' functions as a demonstrative adjective clarifying the noun 'balancing', which itself refers clearly to the act of weighing both potential and risks, thereby avoiding any pronoun reference issues.

Option (D), '[neither]', is part of the correlative conjunction 'neither...nor', which correctly dictates that the verb 'were' agrees with the nearer subject 'eager apprentices' (plural).

Option (C), '[were often]', correctly uses the plural verb 'were' to agree with its plural subject 'nuances', despite the intervening singular phrase 'rather than mere quantitative output'. Option (D), '[she had championed]', is correct; the pronoun 'she' clearly refers to Dr. Eleanor Vance, and the past perfect tense 'had championed' is appropriately used to describe an action completed before or continuing up to the main verb 'emphasized'.

Option (C), '[one not overlook]', accurately employs the subjunctive mood after the expression of necessity 'it is crucial that'; the base form of the verb 'overlook' is correct here. Option (D), '[rather than an unbridled enthusiasm,]', functions correctly as a parenthetical phrase, set off by commas, contrasting 'a cautious approach' with 'an unbridled enthusiasm' without creating a parallelism error.

Option (D), '[such]', is appropriately used as a predicate nominative in the inverted clause 'for such was the enduring power of its themes,' functioning grammatically to describe the power. Option (E), '[this]', functions as a demonstrative adjective modifying the noun 'phenomenon' within a correctly formed absolute phrase, 'this phenomenon defying all predictions of its premature decline.'

Option (D), '[was nevertheless deemed]', employs the singular verb 'was deemed' which correctly agrees with the singular subject 'decision'. 'Nevertheless' is used appropriately as an adverb modifying 'deemed' within the clause, rather than as a conjunctive adverb connecting two independent clauses, thus requiring no semicolon.

Option (D), '[whom]', is correctly used as the object of the preposition 'among'. Additionally, within the embedded relative clause, 'whom' serves as the object of the verb 'considered' (the author considered *whom* to be benevolent).

Option (D), '[demonstrated]', is the past tense verb for the subject 'data'. While 'data' can be considered singular or plural, the past tense form 'demonstrated' remains consistent for both, thus avoiding any subject-verb agreement error.

Option (D), '[was admissible]', maintains proper subject-verb agreement between the singular subject 'testimony' and the singular verb 'was'.

'It' acts as the subject of the absolute phrase, referring to 'the prevailing theory', and 'having been challenged' is a perfect participial phrase. Option (C), '[that most]', is correct; 'that' properly introduces a relative clause modifying 'fact', and 'most' functions as a plural pronoun (referring to most scientists) correctly taking the plural verb 'acknowledge'. Option (D), '[few openly]', is a valid elliptical construction, implicitly meaning 'but few [scientists] openly champion [the theory]'. 'Few' is a plural pronoun, correctly matched with the plural verb 'champion', which is modified by the adverb 'openly'.

Option (D) properly uses a semicolon to separate two independent clauses, and 'this demanding schedule' correctly uses 'this' as a demonstrative adjective modifying 'schedule', which refers back to 'new training regimen', thus avoiding a general pronoun reference error. The elliptical adverbial clause 'though initially met with resistance' (implying 'though it was initially met with resistance') is also grammatically sound.

Option (D), '[whose initial reservations about]', uses the possessive 'whose' correctly and maintains proper subject-verb agreement, as the plural subject 'reservations' correctly agrees with the plural verb 'were well-known', despite the intervening phrase.

Option (B), '[comprising members from disparate factions,]', is a correctly used participial phrase modifying 'the council', with 'comprising' appropriately meaning 'consisting of'. Option (C), '[that the region prosper]', correctly employs the subjunctive mood for the verb 'prosper' within a noun clause expressing a desire, which requires the base form of the verb regardless of the subject's number. Option (D), '[each of them]', is a grammatically correct pronoun phrase functioning as the object of 'swayed', with 'each' correctly referring to individual members.

Option (D), '[for]', maintains proper parallelism with 'because of' in the correlative construction 'not only because of...but also for...,' as both introduce prepositional phrases.
