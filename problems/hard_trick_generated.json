        "answer": "A",
        "solution": "The sentence contains no grammatical errors. Option (B), '[the defendant, his face pale and his composure visibly shaken,]', is grammatically sound. 'The defendant' serves as the subject of the main clause, and the phrase 'his face pale and his composure visibly shaken' functions as a correct absolute phrase, offering additional descriptive detail about the defendant without creating a fragment or misplaced modifier. Option (C), '[even as the jury, their skepticism palpable,]', correctly uses 'their' to refer to the individual members implied by the collective noun 'jury' in this context, which is an acceptable agreement when the focus is on the members rather than the group as a single unit. Option (D), '[him]', is correctly in the object case as it serves as the object of the participle 'finding' within the participial phrase 'ultimately finding him guilty'.

Option (C), '[its perceived feasibility,]', maintains proper parallelism with the preceding phrase, with 'its' again referring to 'proposal'. Option (D), '[be reviewed thoroughly]', correctly employs the mandative subjunctive mood, which is required after verbs of demand like 'stipulated'; in this mood, the base form 'be' is used regardless of the singular subject 'each proposal'.

Option (C) '[was finally presented]' is correctly in the singular past tense, agreeing with the singular subject 'data'. Option (D) '[each a luminary in their respective fields,]' is a grammatically sound appositive phrase modifying the plural noun 'members', making 'their' an appropriate pronoun referring to 'members'.

Option (D), '[and the considerable risks]', correctly completes the parallel structure initiated by 'both', balancing the noun phrase 'the potential for significant market expansion' with another noun phrase. Option (E), '[this careful balancing]', introduces a grammatically correct absolute phrase, where 'this' functions as a demonstrative adjective clarifying the noun 'balancing', which itself refers clearly to the act of weighing both potential and risks, thereby avoiding any pronoun reference issues.

Option (D), '[neither]', is part of the correlative conjunction 'neither...nor', which correctly dictates that the verb 'were' agrees with the nearer subject 'eager apprentices' (plural).

Option (C), '[were often]', correctly uses the plural verb 'were' to agree with its plural subject 'nuances', despite the intervening singular phrase 'rather than mere quantitative output'. Option (D), '[she had championed]', is correct; the pronoun 'she' clearly refers to Dr. Eleanor Vance, and the past perfect tense 'had championed' is appropriately used to describe an action completed before or continuing up to the main verb 'emphasized'.

Option (C), '[one not overlook]', accurately employs the subjunctive mood after the expression of necessity 'it is crucial that'; the base form of the verb 'overlook' is correct here. Option (D), '[rather than an unbridled enthusiasm,]', functions correctly as a parenthetical phrase, set off by commas, contrasting 'a cautious approach' with 'an unbridled enthusiasm' without creating a parallelism error.

Additionally, within the embedded relative clause, 'whom' serves as the object of the verb 'considered' (the author considered *whom* to be benevolent).

While 'data' can be considered singular or plural, the past tense form 'demonstrated' remains consistent for both, thus avoiding any subject-verb agreement error.

Option (D), '[was admissible]', maintains proper subject-verb agreement between the singular subject 'testimony' and the singular verb 'was'.

Option (D), '[whose initial reservations about]', uses the possessive 'whose' correctly and maintains proper subject-verb agreement, as the plural subject 'reservations' correctly agrees with the plural verb 'were well-known', despite the intervening phrase.

Option (D), '[each of them]', is a grammatically correct pronoun phrase functioning as the object of 'swayed', with 'each' correctly referring to individual members.

Option (D), '[for]', maintains proper parallelism with 'because of' in the correlative construction 'not only because of...but also for...,' as both introduce prepositional phrases.

However, the subject of the main clause that follows is \"the jury's decision.\" A decision cannot review evidence or deliberate, meaning the implied subject of the introductory phrase does not match the grammatical subject of the main clause, thus creating a dangling modifier.",

        "solution": "Option (B), '[the book's publication]', results in a Dangling Modifier (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase 'Having been meticulously reviewed by the entire editorial team over several months' logically implies that 'the book' (or its manuscript) was the entity undergoing review. However, the grammatical subject of the main clause that follows is 'the book's publication'. The publication itself was not reviewed; rather, the book was reviewed, leading to its publication. Since the implied subject of the participial phrase ('the book') does not match the grammatical subject of the main clause ('the book's publication'), the introductory phrase 'dangles', creating an unclear and grammatically incorrect sentence. In contrast, '[its]' (C) is a possessive pronoun correctly referring to 'the book's', and '[many critics initially questioning its premise]' (D) is a grammatically sound absolute phrase, which, unlike a dangling modifier, has its own subject ('critics') and modifies the entire main clause without needing to share the main clause's subject.",
