Option (B), 'who doubted', correctly uses the subject pronoun 'who' to refer to 'publishers' as the subject of the verb 'doubted'. 'Its' clearly refers to the manuscript's commercial viability.

In (D), the pronoun 'them' clearly and correctly refers to 'regulations', and its case is appropriate as the object of the infinitive 'to circumvent'.

Option (D) presents 'not only the primary text but also the intricate marginalia' with parallel noun phrases, fulfilling the requirement for correlative conjunctions.

Option (D), 'many students', is the subject of the main clause and is grammatically sound. Option (E), 'whose initial aptitude', correctly uses the possessive relative pronoun 'whose' to refer to 'students', and the singular verb 'was' correctly agrees with the singular subject 'aptitude' within its clause.

Option (B), 'having studied extensively for weeks', is a correctly formed participial phrase whose implied subject is 'the student', the subject of the main clause, thus avoiding a Dangling Modifier. Option (C), 'who was generally diligent', is an adjective clause correctly modifying 'the student'; the relative pronoun 'who' functions as the subject of its clause and agrees in number with 'was'. Option (D), 'that neither the intricate calculus problems nor the challenging physics concepts were easy', correctly handles subject-verb agreement for a 'neither...nor' construction: the verb 'were' agrees with the nearer plural subject 'physics concepts'.

        "answer": "A",
        "solution": "The sentence contains no grammatical errors. The introductory participial phrase 'Having meticulously analyzed...' correctly modifies 'the team of geologists', which is the subject of the main clause, thus avoiding a Dangling Modifier. The collective noun 'team' is treated as a singular unit, making 'was convinced' an appropriate singular verb, which correctly avoids an Agreement error. The phrases 'renowned for its innovative research methods' and 'consistently reshaping prevailing scientific paradigms' are parallel participial constructions modifying 'the team of geologists', and the construction 'not an isolated incident but rather part of a larger...shift' correctly employs parallelism with coordinating conjunctions. Finally, 'a finding' acts as a grammatically sound appositive, summarizing the preceding clause, with 'that promised to rewrite geological textbooks' being an appropriate adjective clause modifying 'finding'.

Option (D) 'it became' correctly uses the expletive pronoun 'it' to introduce the main clause. Option (E) 'predicted to befall' is a correctly placed participial phrase modifying 'cataclysm'.

In this sentence, the entire noun clause 'whomever the faculty committee determines has displayed the greatest academic potential' functions as the object of the preposition 'to'. However, the case of the pronoun within that clause ('whoever' or 'whomever') is determined by its function within its *own* sub-clause. The phrase 'the faculty committee determines' acts as an interrupter. When we remove this interrupter, it becomes clear that 'whoever/whomever' is the subject of the verb 'has displayed'.

Adverbial modifiers should be placed closer to the word they are intended to modify to prevent such confusion.

        "answer": "B",
        "solution": "Option (B), 'a remote, uncharted island was visited', results in a DANGLING MODIFIER (DM) error. The introductory participial phrase 'Seeking a rare botanical specimen that had eluded explorers for centuries' implies that the one performing the action of 'seeking' is the expedition or its members. However, the grammatical subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'a remote, uncharted island'. An island cannot 'seek' a specimen, meaning the modifier has nothing logical to modify and thus 'dangles'. The sentence should be restructured so that the subject of the main clause is the one performing the action described by the verbal phrase, for example: 'Seeking a rare botanical specimen..., the expedition visited a remote, uncharted island.'",

        "solution": "Option (B), 'the backup generator was finally activated', creates a DANGLING MODIFIER (DM) error. The introductory verbal phrase 'Having to quickly adapt...' implies a subject capable of adapting to the power outage, such as 'the building manager' or 'the residents'. However, the subject of the main clause is 'the backup generator', which cannot logically perform the action of 'having to adapt'. Since the implied subject of the verbal phrase does not match the subject of the main clause, the modifier is left dangling, leading to an illogical sentence structure.",

The introductory participial phrase 'Having meticulously reviewed all the financial reports' implies that the subject of the main clause performed the action of reviewing. However, the grammatical subject of the main clause is 'a significant discrepancy', which cannot logically perform the action of reviewing. The implied subject of the participial phrase (the audit team) does not match the grammatical subject of the main clause ('a significant discrepancy').

The introductory participial phrase 'Having meticulously prepared for weeks' has an implied subject (Sarah) that is performing the action of preparing. However, the subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'the marathon'. Since the implied subject of the verbal (Sarah) is not the grammatical subject of the main clause ('the marathon'), the phrase dangles, illogically suggesting that the marathon itself prepared for weeks. To correct this, the subject of the main clause must be the one performing the action, for instance: 'Having meticulously prepared for weeks, Sarah found the marathon a grueling test.'",

The introductory infinitive phrase, 'To secure the highest possible score,' has an implied subject\u2014someone who performs the action of securing the score.

        "solution": "Option (B), 'a verdict', is the subject of the main clause, but it is not the implied subject of the introductory verbal phrase 'After carefully weighing all the available evidence and consulting with numerous experts'. A 'verdict' cannot 'weigh evidence' or 'consult experts'; it is something that is reached. The introductory phrase therefore dangles, as it lacks a logical subject to modify in the main clause, creating a DANGLING MODIFIER (DM) error.

        "solution": "Option (B), 'Having meticulously proofread every page and corrected all typographical errors,', is a DANGLING MODIFIER (DM) error. The implied subject of the participial phrase 'Having meticulously proofread...' is the one performing the action of proofreading and correcting. However, the subject of the main clause that follows is 'the publishing house'. While a publishing house is responsible for these actions, it is an organization and not the direct agent that physically 'proofreads' or 'corrects' in the same way an individual or a team would.

The implied subject of the introductory participial phrase 'having amassed' is the person or entity who did the amassing (such as the prosecutor or an investigative team).

The introductory phrase 'After meticulously calibrating the intricate machinery for weeks' is a prepositional phrase containing a gerund. The implied subject of this verbal phrase is the person or team performing the calibration. However, the subject of the main clause that immediately follows is 'the final experiment'.

To correct this, the implied subject of 'analyzing' must also be the subject of the main clause, for instance, by stating, \"After analyzing the complex financial data for weeks, the analysts finally discerned a clear pattern...\" or \"After the team analyzed the complex financial data for weeks, a clear pattern finally emerged...\"",
